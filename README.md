# Skin Cancer Detection Using AI

This project aims to utilize artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for early detection of skin cancer. By leveraging deep learning and image analysis methodologies, the system can accurately classify skin lesions, aiding dermatologists in timely diagnoses and potentially improving patient outcomes.

## Dataset

The project utilizes two datasets available on Kaggle:

1. [Skin Cancer 9 Classes ISIC dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nodoubttome/skin-cancer9-classesisic)
2. [Skin Cancer MNIST HAM10000 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000)

These datasets provide diverse and extensive collections of skin lesion images, essential for training robust AI models.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Download the datasets from the provided Kaggle links and preprocess the images as needed.
   
2. **Training**: Train the AI model using deep learning techniques on the preprocessed dataset. Ensure to optimize hyperparameters for best performance.

3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model using appropriate metrics to assess its accuracy and performance.

4. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model for skin cancer detection, integrating it into existing healthcare systems or as a standalone application for dermatologists.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
